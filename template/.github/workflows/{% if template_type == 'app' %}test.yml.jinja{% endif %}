# This is the main workflow for testing the code before and after
# packaging it.
# The workflow is divided into three jobs:
# 1. env-prepare:
#    - Prepare the environment for testing
# 2. source-test:
#    - Test the code base against the latest code in the repository
#    - Create the Python package
#    - Upload the Python package for the next job
# 3. package-test:
#    - Download the Python package (including extra files) from the previous job
#    - Install the downloaded Python package
#    - Test the code base against the installed package
# 4. dashboard-build-trigger:
#    - Trigger the dashboard build workflow to update the code quality
#      metrics on the dashboard
